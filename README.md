# Notch for Windows
Have a Windows computer and want to feel like you have the newest Macbook? You can by getting your very own notch!

A very basic method of getting the 'notch' on your computer, make sure to not use a monitor otherwise the monitor will magically get a notch XD

Please note: this is a very scuffed version since it was put together in five minutes (not joking, check the commit log)

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment using the command `virtualenv -p python3 venv` and then activate the virtual environment by doing `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Install `requirements.txt` using pip via `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the file using `python main.py`
4. Profit

Note: I may have 'guesstimated' some values for the size of the 'notch' haha

Note 2: TO exit the project, just stop the execution of the code :)
